  <h1>About Hetri</h1>
  <p>We're revolutionizing pet care through innovative technology that brings peace of mind to pet owners and operational excellence to facilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Hetri was born from a simple observation: while technology has transformed many industries, pet care facilities were still relying on outdated systems and manual processes. Our founder, during their time at Cal Poly Pomona, was inspired by a professor's challenge to "be different". To find innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
  
  <p>This philosophy led to the creation of the Hetri Collar and PAW management system, combining cutting-edge hardware with intelligent software to create a seamless experience for both pet owners and facility operators.</p>

  <div class="founder-quote">
    "We believe in technology that enhances human experience, not complicate it. Our smart collar is a statement about how we approach innovation. User-centric, scalable, and deeply practical."
