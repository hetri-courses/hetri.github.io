## What We Do

At Hetri, we create systems that work *with* people, not just for them. Our smart collar enables live pet monitoring through streaming technology, offering peace of mind to pet owners and operational transparency to daycares.

Our focus is on creating meaningful, real-time connections through embedded technology. We believe in solving immediate, real-world problems with precision and care.

## Why It Matters

Technology should enhance human experience, not complicate it. Our smart collar isn't just a product, it's a statement about how we approach innovation: user-centric, scalable, and deeply practical.

This solution serves as a foundation for future tools that enrich life and provide intelligent insights, without overwhelming the user.
