    <h2>Professional Animal Works (PAW)</h2>
    <p>We built PAW by Hetri to give dog daycare and resort owners a superpower: live dog’s eye video right in your dashboard. Imagine your clients watching their pup explore in real time, then tapping once to send a treat or call for help.</p>

    <p>That collar feed is not just a gimmick. Every frame, every dispense event and every help request gets recorded in our database so you know exactly what happened, when and why. You get a clear audit trail for each pet and instant owner satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Behind the scenes our system analyzes collar telemetry such as activity bursts, rest cycles and weight to forecast staffing needs and optimize schedules before each day starts. No more last minute scramble or guesswork.</p>

    <p>With PAW you deliver an unforgettable premium experience for pet parents while running your operations on data you can trust. Let us help you make your facility the one everyone talks about.</p>
